## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.4.0 - 2026-04-25

### Performance, Stability, and UI Improvements

- Replaced the sync task selection and confirmation modals with an interactive file-tree interface, allowing visually browse and select specific files or folders for synchronization.
- Enabled reliable resumption of large file downloads by implementing chunked storage, ensuring that interrupted transfers can continue from where they left off without restarting.
- Optimized memory usage during sync operations by introducing smart load balancing, which prevents performance spikes and keeps the application responsive even when handling gigabytes at once.
- Simplified the sync progress display and behavior, providing a clearer and more consistent view of ongoing synchronization tasks.
- Added an option to recursively traverse all remote directories (`Depth: infinity`) in one request to further improve performance.
- Streamlined sync settings by renaming "Fast Sync" to "Fast Realtime Sync" for clarity and removing the confusing "Sync Mode" option, reducing configuration complexity.
- Standardized the settings interface with improved input validation, reusable components, and human-readable file size and time conversions, making it easier to configure and understand sync preferences.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.3.2 - 2026-04-14

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.3.0 - 2026-04-13

**Note: breaking change present (moved WebDAV credential into secret store), but auto-migration available. The real intrusion is zero for most users.**

### Security / credentials

- Store WebDAV credentials in Obsidian’s credential storage instead of plaintext settings.
- Added a migration that moves existing plaintext tokens into the secret store.

### Sync engine / behavior

- Supported syncing the `.obsidian/` config folder (excluded by default).

- Added fallback handling for non-mergeable files when smart merge is selected.
- Moved conflict-resolution strategy settings into the settings model and updated the sync decision flow accordingly.

- Switched vault traversal, stat reads, content reads, and trashing to adapter-based async APIs.
- Introduced a vault-aware trash file location now respects user's configured trash location instead of into Obsidian trash.

### Internationalization / settings cleanup

- Replaced i18next with a lightweight custom translation helper and typed translation keys to decrease bundle size and improve performance.
- Fixed language auto detection that always display English.
- Removed the manual language setting and the related i18n setup service. Now the i18n option is entirely integrated with Obsidian's language setting.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.2.0 - 2026-04-11

### Memory and performance optimizations

- Replaced the rxjs-based sync event bus with lightweight hooks/ref helpers, simplifying sync state propagation across the modal, ribbon, commands, unload flow, and related UI/services.
- Refactored sync task handling and logging to reduce noise, tighten typing, remove unnecessary async/await patterns, and simplify progress summary structures.
- Changed planning to create tasks directly from current file stats instead of snapshot-based planning, and moved file-content loading into push/pull/merge tasks for lazier, more targeted fetches.
- Removed the planning “deciding” substage and updated progress/i18n text accordingly.
- Introduced a maxConcurrentSyncTasks setting and updated task optimization to chunk work by the new concurrency limit.
- Raised the default maxConcurrentWebDAVCalls to 100 and migrated existing configs from 0.

### Sync correctness and compatibility

- Updated delete-confirmation reupload handling to rebuild uploads from the current vault state.
- Added compatibility fixes for obsidian-paste-image-rename by preserving ctime on local file creation during pull and separating file vs folder stats in task interfaces.
- Adjusted conflict resolution logic to handle file-only conflicts more accurately.
- Added remote mkdir handling when reuploading deleted directories.
- Removed unnecessary recursive remote directory creation in mkdir handling.
- Eliminated unnecessary async calls in the two-way decider to improve planning performance.

### Localization, docs, and maintenance

- Added Russian translations for the webdav explorer UI.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.1.0 - 2026-04-08

### Sync planning and execution

- Reworked two-way sync planning into explicit file/folder/file-folder collections, simplifying the decision flow and removing redundant per-path branching.
- Added cancelable traversal/planning by propagating throwIfCancelled through WebDAV traversal and decider loops.
- Changed task creation and optimization to run grouped mkdir/push/pull/remove/merge work concurrently.
- Renamed conflict handling from conflict-resolve to merge across planning, settings, UI, and migrations, and centralized merge snapshot handling.
- Simplified mkdir handling by removing recursive mkdir task chains and tightening path/subpath validation.
- Optimized delete/reupload syncing by replacing an O(n²) lookup with a Map, and improved task ordering by sorting directories via path segment depth.
- Consolidated traversal, path normalization, and stat conversion helpers into shared utilities, and removed the local-walk planning report.
- Simplify change detection and loose-mode handling

### Settings, localization, and UI

- Expanded i18n language handling with a shared language map, normalized auto-detection, and a fix for zh-Hans detection.
- Made language settings accept arbitrary values and populate the dropdown dynamically.
- Updated sync progress and observability UI to use i18n-driven run kinds, raw paths, and clearer percent/count display.
- Replaced the old sync run-type formatter with direct localization lookups and added/adjusted conflict-related translation keys.
- Replaced settings migration flow with a new processing pipeline and added the prune base text store migration.

### Logging and build output

- Enhanced logger output with plugin version and log-length information.
- Added a shared VERSION constant and wired version injection into the build config.

### Cleanup, performance, and internal API tightening

- Centralized ArrayBuffer-to-text conversion into a shared utility and removed duplicated serializers from task classes.
- Simplified task and engine internals by reducing noisy debug payloads, removing unused types/files, and cleaning imports.
- Corrected a misleading execution error message in AddRecordTask.
- Refined mergeability checks so base text is only computed when needed.

## Obsidian WebDAV Sync v2.0.0 - 2026-04-05

### Huge Internal Refactor

**Many breaking changes are present although auto migration is provided. Strongly recommended to backup before upgrade.**
