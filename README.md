## Introduction

Obsidian WebDAV Sync is a general-purpose syncing plugin for Obsidian via a WebDAV server.

There's already a lot of plugins to sync your notes between devices. But when we have a look at the syncing plugin landscape, we can clearly see that each plugin has its own disadvantages that prevents you from using it:

- [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save): full-featured syncing plugin, but currently unmaintained and full of bugs (like [deleted files come back](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save/issues/985)).
- [Syncthing Integration](https://github.com/LBF38/obsidian-syncthing-integration): a great way of P2P syncing, but requires both of your devices to be online, not 24/7.
- [Live Sync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync): most robust solution in the room, but requires custom server setup.
- [Git Integration](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git): ideal for production-level collaboration and provenance, but not suitable for daily usage.
- Vendor-specific Syncing Plugin (like [Nutstore Sync](https://github.com/nutstore/obsidian-nutstore-sync)): tailored experiences, but locked to a single vendor.

Acknowledging that WebDAV would be the most convenient DIY solution for syncing, this plugin comes to provide a balanced experience of day-to-day convenience, easy setup, and the robustness that doesn't make your notes into a chaos.

## Common Questions

<details><summary>Does this plugin support syncing Obsidian config folder (.obsidian)?</summary>

Yes, but this folder is excluded from syncing by default. To sync specific files or folders inside, (for example, Obsidian settings), you can go to plugin settings - `Filter Rules` - `Inclusion rules` and add a new rule `.obsidian/app.json`.

To sync the entire folder, which includes all settings, CSS snippets, and plugins, go to plugin settings - `Filter Rules` - `Exclusion rules`, and remove `.obsidian`.

</details>

<details><summary>Why 401 unauthorized error happens?</summary>

The most likely cause of this error is the rate limit of your WebDAV provider. You can adjust the rate control in the plugin settings.

Detailed solution is in [this issue](https://github.com/hesprs/obsidian-webdav-sync/issues/57).

</details>

<details><summary>What should I do if I get an error during syncing?</summary>

You can simply retry the sync. An error does not block later syncs nor corrupt your files.

If the error persists after retrying, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hesprs/obsidian-webdav-sync/issues/new), describing the error, your setup, with the support log attached.

</details>

<details><summary>How should I manage my WebDAV storage when using this plugin?</summary>

According to this plugin's [file handling strategy](https://hesprs.github.io/projects/obsidian-webdav-sync#technical-breakdown), all remote changes will be propagated to all vaults. So it's generally not recommended to manually manage your WebDAV storage unless you intend to add / remove these files.

The only scenario you may need to manually delete some files happens when you exclude some files that were previously synced, now they will not be detected but remain on your WebDAV. These files are kept on remote to prevent false deletion. If you are sure that you have excluded these files in ALL your devices, you can manually clean up these files on your WebDAV.
