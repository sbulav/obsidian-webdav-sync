## Introduction

Obsidian WebDAV Sync is a general-purpose syncing plugin for Obsidian via a WebDAV server.

There's already a lot of plugins to sync your notes between devices. But when we have a look at the syncing plugin landscape, we can clearly see that each plugin has its own disadvantages that prevents you from using it:

- [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save): full-featured syncing plugin, but currently unmaintained and full of bugs (like [deleted files come back](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save/issues/985)).
- [Syncthing Integration](https://github.com/LBF38/obsidian-syncthing-integration): a great way of P2P syncing, but requires both of your devices to be online, not 24/7.
- [Live Sync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync): most robust solution in the room, but requires custom server setup.
- [Git Integration](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git): ideal for production-level collaboration and provenance, but not suitable for daily usage.
- Vendor-specific Syncing Plugin (like [Nutstore Sync](https://github.com/nutstore/obsidian-nutstore-sync)): tailored experiences, but locked to a single vendor.

Acknowledging that WebDAV would be the most convenient DIY solution for syncing, this plugin comes to provide a balanced experience of day-to-day convenience, easy setup, and the robustness that doesn't make your notes into a chaos.

## Features

- 🔄 **Bidirectional syncing** between local vault and remote WebDAV
- ⚡ **Fast syncing mode** with cached acceleration for fast, sync-on-change syncing
- 📁 **WebDAV explorer** for exploring remote directories
- 🔀 **Conflict handling**:
  - Smart merge (diff/merge-based)
  - Latest-version strategy
  - Skip strategy
- 🚀 **Strict / loose sync modes** for different vault sizes
- 📦 **Large file skipping** via configurable size threshold
- 🔁 **Robust file presence handling** that doesn't mess up your notes
- 📜 **Lightweight local database** empowers scalability and ensures performance

## Install & Setup

This plugin is currently in beta. You can install it using the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin:

1. Go to **Community plugins** and search for `BRAT`
2. Install and enable it
3. Go to BRAT settings, click **Add beta plugin**, copy and paste `https://github.com/hesprs/obsidian-webdav-sync` into the _Repository_ field
4. Select the latest version and click **Add plugin**

Configuration:

2. Enter account + credential
3. Click **Check connection**
4. Select remote directory

## Notes

- Initial sync may take longer for large vaults
- Backup important notes before first sync
- The file presence resolution and note merging are robust, but not perfect

## Development Roadmap
